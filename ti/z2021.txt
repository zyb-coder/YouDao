Rats and other animals need to be highly at tuned to social signals from others so that can identify friends to cooperate with and enemies to avoid  To find out if this extends to non-living beings  Loleh Quinn at the University of California  San Diego  and her colleagues tested whether rats can detect social signals form robotic rats 
They housed eight adult rats with two types of robotic rat- one social and one asocial一for 5 our days  The robots rats were quite minimalist  resembling a chunkier version of a computer mouse with wheels-to move around and colorful markings 
During the experiment  the social robot rat followed the living rats around  played with the same toys  and opened caged doors to let trapped rats escape  Meanwhile  the asocial robot simply moved forwards and backwards and side to side
Next  the researchers trapped the robots in cages and gave the rats the opportunity to release them by pressing a lever 
Across 18 trials each  the living rats were 52 percent more likely on average to set the social robot free than the asocial one  This suggests that the rats perceived the social robot as a genuine social being  They may have bonded more with the social robot because it displayed behaviours like communal exploring and playing  This could lead to the rats better remembering having freed it earlier  and wanting the robot to return the favour when they get trapped  says Quinn 
The readiness of the rats to befriend the social robot was surprising given its minimal design  The robot was the same size as a regular rat but resembled a simple plastic box on wheels “We' d assumed we' d have to give it a moving head and tail  facial features  and put a scene on it to make it smell like a real rat  but that wasn’t necessary  ”says Janet Wiles at the University of Queensland in Australia  who helped with the research 
The finding shows how sensitive rats are to social cues  even when they come from basic robots  Similarly  children tend to treat robots as if they are fellow beings  even when they display only simple social signals “ We humans seem to be fascinated by robots  and it turns out other animals are too ”says Wiles 
Quin and her colleagues conducted a test to see if rats can
pickup social signals from non-living rats
distinguish a friendly rat from a hostile one
attain sociable traits through special training
send out warning messages to their fellow
What did the social robot do during the experiment 
It followed the social robot 
It played with some toys 
It set the trapped rats free 
It moved around alone 
According to Quinn  the rats released the social robot because they
tried to practice a means of escape
expected it to do the same in return
wanted to display their intelligence
considered that an interesting game
James Wiles notes that rats
can remember other rat's facial features
differentiate smells better than sizes
respond more to cations than to looks
can be scared by a plastic box on wheels
It can be learned from the text that rats
appear to be adaptable to new surroundings
are more socially active than other animals
behave differently from children in socializing
are more sensitive to social cues than expected
